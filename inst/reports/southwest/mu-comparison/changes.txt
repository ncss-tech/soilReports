2018-05-29 (3.3.6): density curves are now truncated at min/max values, NASS CDL now included in the default config, adding TODO items for multivariate summary / low-variance warnings
2018-02-07 (3.3.5): boxplots now use variable width, proportional to sample size; new option in config.R: scaleDensityCurves=TRUE|FALSE
